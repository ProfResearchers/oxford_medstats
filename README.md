> *Exploring medicine through data, evidence, and reproducible analysis.*  

---

## 🧭 Overview  

We are a group of **medical students from Ondokuz Mayıs University** passionate about **clinical research**, **biostatistics**, and **evidence synthesis**.  
Our mission is to build a bridge between **medical knowledge** and **quantitative reasoning** — by applying statistical methods to real-world clinical problems, as guided by the *Oxford Handbook of Medical Statistics* and major evidence-based medicine frameworks.  

---

## 🎯 Objectives  

- Apply core concepts from **Oxford Handbook of Medical Statistics** to real or simulated clinical datasets.  
- Develop open-source, **reproducible workflows** in **R** and **Python** for data analysis, visualization, and interpretation.  
- Contribute to evidence synthesis projects such as **systematic reviews**, **meta-analyses**, and **risk modeling studies**.  
- Help peers learn **applied medical statistics** through clean, transparent examples.

## 📚 Core Projects  

### 🧪 [Role of Antacids in Kidney Stone Formation: A Systematic Review](./antacids-kidney-stones)  
> A registered PROSPERO systematic review exploring the association between **antacid use** and **kidney stone formation** in humans.  

**Status:** Data extraction & risk of bias assessment ongoing  
**Databases:** PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Scopus, Cochrane CENTRAL  
**Goal:** Clarify whether antacid exposure affects stone incidence or type through mechanistic and clinical evidence.

## 🧠 Philosophy  

> “Medicine is a science of uncertainty and an art of probability.” — Sir William Osler  

We believe that mastering medical statistics is essential for critical thinking in modern medicine.  
Our projects aim to make complex analyses transparent, teachable, and clinically meaningful.
