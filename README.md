# 🧬 ProfResearchers Team  

> *Exploring medicine through data, evidence, and reproducible analysis.*  

---

## 🧭 Overview  

We are a group of **medical students from Ondokuz Mayıs University** passionate about **clinical research**, **biostatistics**, and **evidence synthesis**.  
Our mission is to build a bridge between **medical knowledge** and **quantitative reasoning** — by applying statistical methods to real-world clinical problems, as guided by the *Oxford Handbook of Medical Statistics* and major evidence-based medicine frameworks.  

---

## 🎯 Objectives  

- Apply core concepts from **Oxford Handbook of Medical Statistics** to real or simulated clinical datasets.  
- Develop open-source, **reproducible workflows** in **R** and **Python** for data analysis, visualization, and interpretation.  
- Contribute to evidence synthesis projects such as **systematic reviews**, **meta-analyses**, and **risk modeling studies**.  
- Help peers learn **applied medical statistics** through clean, transparent examples.

### 📊 Oxford Medical Statistics Series  

Our ongoing project systematically applies statistical principles and methods from the *Oxford Handbook of Medical Statistics* to real and simulated clinical research scenarios.  
Each module focuses on one major theme or chapter from the handbook, translating theory into reproducible, hands-on analysis.

| Module | Topic | Focus |
|---------|--------|-------|
| 01 | Research Design | Framing clinical questions, study types, sampling, bias, confounding |
| 02 | Collecting and Handling Data | Data collection methods, cleaning, validation, missing data |
| 03 | Presenting Research Findings | Tables, graphs, descriptive summaries, and effective communication |
| 04 | Statistical Software | Using R and Python for medical data analysis |
| 05 | Summarizing Data | Measures of central tendency, variability, and data visualization |
| 06 | Probability and Distributions | Probability concepts, normal distribution, and other key models |
| 07 | Statistical Tests | Parametric and nonparametric hypothesis testing |
| 08 | Diagnostic Studies | Sensitivity, specificity, predictive values, and ROC analysis |
| 09 | Other Statistical Methods | Nonlinear models, resampling, and advanced inference tools |
| 10 | Multiple Observations per Subject | Repeated-measures analysis and longitudinal data handling |
| 11 | Multiple Variables per Subject | Multivariable analysis and regression modeling |
| 12 | Meta-analysis | Combining evidence across studies and assessing heterogeneity |
| 13 | Bayesian Statistics | Bayesian inference and clinical decision-making frameworks |

Each module includes:
- A brief **clinical or epidemiological context**  
- **Dataset** (simulated or anonymized clinical data)  
- **R/Python code** demonstrating analysis workflow  
- **Interpretation and discussion** of results in clinical terms

## 🧠 Philosophy  

> “Medicine is a science of uncertainty and an art of probability.” — Sir William Osler  

We believe that mastering medical statistics is essential for critical thinking in modern medicine.  
Our projects aim to make complex analyses transparent, teachable, and clinically meaningful.
